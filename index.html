            <p>Hello! As a dedicated and versatile professional, I bring a unique blend of technical prowess and athletic discipline to the table. With a background in mechanical engineering, I made a bold leap into the IT field driven by my friends' enthusiasm for coding during college. This transition has been immensely rewarding, allowing me to carve out a niche as a Salesforce Developer with a proven track record of delivering robust and user-friendly applications. I've spearheaded two successful projects within the Salesforce ecosystem and have also ventured into front-end development, showcasing my ability to adapt and excel across different domains. Off the screen, I shine as a national-level volleyball player, boasting a rich experience of competing in four national championships across India's diverse landscape. This dynamic background fuels my approach to every endeavor, be it crafting innovative solutions in Salesforce or representing my state on the volleyball court. Committed to excellence and continuous improvement, I eagerly anticipate leveraging my diverse skills and experiences to drive impactful projects and foster collaborative teamwork.</p>
